Blogs, though an infamous model these days, are the best source to tell the world about yourself. With a personalized touch, they give you the creativity you desire. Our aim, is to use this personal touch, and implement it in such a way (Specially for the introverts), that brings a community together and more well known, which in our case, happens to be our college. The features we propose to enhance the user experience are:

1. User Management

3. Social Sharing
4. Commenting system
5. Following and Notifications
